# Learning Link

 Learning Link is meant to make it easy for students and their parents to find a tutor to help support their learning.  There are two user roles, student and tutor.  Students can search for tutors that meet their needs, add them to their dashboard, send messages through the app and, and schedule tutoring sessions through the calendar.
